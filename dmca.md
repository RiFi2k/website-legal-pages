If you believe that material available on our site infringes on your copyright(s), please notify us by providing a DMCA notice. Upon receipt of a valid and complete notice, we will remove the material.

Before submitting a DMCA notice, it’s important to consider if the manner in which the material is used falls under **[fair use](http://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html)**. If you are not sure whether material located on our site infringes your copyright, or if it is subject to fair use protections, you should first consider seeking legal advice.

**Please be advised that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing.** In addition, you are required to consider the possible fair use implications, as a result of [Lenz v. Universal](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit). We reserve the right to challenge abuses of the DMCA process, and your submission to us does not waive that right.

**Your DMCA notice will be reviewed, and also may be sent to third parties such as **[**LumenDatabase.org**](http://www.lumendatabase.org/)**

Please follow these steps to file a notice:

1. **Contact the us directly.** Email us informally and we will most likely be able to resolve the issue quickly without having to get all "super legal".
2. **Send your complaint to our designated agent via email**, if the issue cannot be resolved with the inital informal corespondence.
